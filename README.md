# RSA

## Summery
Simple RSA implementation with detail to readabiltiy, meant to demonstrate
how the algorithm works. The C programming language was chosen for this
implementation due to the similarity in syntax to other languages.

This was written for educational purposes. This implementation is vulnerable to
countless cryptanalysis attacks, and is not considered secure nor intended for
use in production systems.

**THIS IS NOT MEANT TO BE USED AS A FUNCTIONAL PROGRAM, BUT RATHER A GUIDE
TO UNDERSTANDING RSA. IT IS ASSUMED THE CODE WILL BE READ.**

## Binaries
Two binaries can be built: *rsa* and *rsa_tests*. The first will produce a
keypair given p and q, and a limit for the prime number generator used
internally.

The RSA keypair is (e,n), (d,n).

The second binary was simply used to act as a very basic form of unit test
ensuring encryption and decryption works.

## Compatability
This was written and tested on a Linux computer running Kernel 4.2.
It should work on any Linux with gcc installed.

Care was taken to keep this program as simple as possible. No external libraries
were used.

## The Algorithm
### RSA Algorithm
**Based on**: ((m\*\*e)\*\*d) % n = m
e : encryption, d: decryption

**Encryption**: ciphertext = (message\*\*e) % n

**Decryption**: (c**d == (m\*\*e)\*\*d == m)  % n

### Key Generation
*p* and *q*, two distinct prime numbers
*n = pq*

fi is Euler's Totient Function
fi(n) = fi(p) \* fi(q) = (p - 1) \* (q - 1) = n - (p + q - 1)

chose e, *the public key* so that:

      1. 1 < e < fi(n)
      2. gcd(e, fi(n)) == 1 (i.e. e and fi(n) are coprime

chose d, *the private key* so that:

      1. d == (e \*\* -1) % fi(n)
      ...d is the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo(fi(n))
